I work on modelling infectious diseases, using mathematical, statistical, and computational methods. I am primarily interested in the simulation and inference of dynamic mechanistic models within practical timeframes.  

Currently, I'm working on modelling hospital-acquired infections in the Victorian health system, under the supervision of [Dr. Michael Lydeamore](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/michael-lydeamore).

I did my PhD in Engineering supervised by [Dr. Oliver J.](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/oliver-maclaren)[ Maclaren](https://omaclaren.com) and [Dr. Vinod Suresh](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/v-suresh) at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

I primarily work in Python. I have some experience with bash and the Linux ecosystem.
